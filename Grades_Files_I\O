/* Write a complete program to input a series of test grades from a file named test.txt 
and report the number of student grades, the number of AS, BS, CS, DS, and FS, the percent 
below average (DS and FS) and the percent above average (AS and BS). 

For the file  test.txt as follows:
     Section-001
     A  C  F  F  D  B  B  C  C  C  A  C  C  B  B  C  D
     Section-005
     C  F  F  D  B  F  C  C  C  A  C  A  B  B  A  D

Output should be:
     33 student grades
     A: 5   B: 7   C: 12   D: 4   F: 5
     Above average: 36.36%
     Below average: 27.27%
