/* Question 2: Write a complete working program that plays a number guessing game.
1.	The program should first generate a random number in the range of 1 – 100 and display a message saying that I have a number, can you guess it?
2.	Next, the program should REPEATEDLY prompt the user for a guess (“Please enter a guess: ”)
3.	Each time the user enters a number, the program should look at the user guess and respond
appropriately with one of the following messages:
a.	“Correct, you win!”
b.	“Too High”
c.	“Too low”
4.	When the user guesses correctly, the program should display a ‘goodbye’ message telling the user how many guesses it took to win the game and then terminate.
5.	The ONLY code in the main() function should be a call to playGame().
6.	The playGame() method should:
a.	declare ALL of the variables needed to play the game and report the outcomes.
b.	Call another method named getRandomNumber(int& number) to set the secret number.
c.	Create a game loop that:
i.	ends when a users guess matches the secret number.
ii.	calls a method named getUserGuess for each new guess (x2)
iii.	passes the user guess and the secret number to a method called evaluateGuess that compares the user input and returns the correct output message.
7.	Print the goodbye message. */
